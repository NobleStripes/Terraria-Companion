# Terraria Companion

A second-screen browser reference for Terraria players. Look up items, track bosses, browse recommended builds by stage, and explore NPC/biome guides — all in one place.

**Data version:** 1.4.5.6 (Bigger & Boulder)

## Features

- **Item Lookup** — Search 350+ items with fuzzy matching, view crafting recipes (crafts & used-in chains), inspect item stats, tool powers, and jump to the wiki
- **Prefix System** — Select prefixes in Item Lookup to preview effective stat changes live (base → prefixed values)
- **Boss Tracker** — All ~16 bosses with gear recommendations and strategy notes; progress is saved to localStorage
- **Recommended Builds** — Stage-based progression builds (Early Game → Endgame) for melee, ranged, magic, and summoner classes
- **NPC Guide** — All ~25 NPCs with full happiness tables and biome filter chips
- **Biome Guide** — All ~20 biomes with resources, enemies, and NPC affinities

## Deployment (Public Users)

Terraria Companion is now distributed only as a standalone local server for public users.

### 🌐 Standalone Server (Recommended)

1. Build the app:
	```bash
	npm install
	npm run build
	```
2. Start the local server:
	```bash
	node server.js
	# or use start-server.bat (Windows) / start-server.sh (macOS/Linux)
	```
3. Open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) in your browser.

No installation or code signing required. Electron distribution is no longer used.

## Data Quality Rules

The project includes an automated data validator at `scripts/validate-items.mjs`.

- Weapons and tools must define `damage`
- Armor must define `defense`
- Summon/whip items must define `critChance: 0`
- `manaCost` is explicit only for magic/summon items

This validator runs automatically as part of `npm run build`.
